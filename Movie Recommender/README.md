For this project, it's used the dataset ml-latest-small downloaded from www.movielens.org. 

#### The Profile Recommender notebook is a notebook that uses the dataset mentioned above to create a genre's rating profile. Then it gets the similarity cosine between each user and, using that, provides a list of the movies a defined user will probably like and a list of movies this user will definetely like.

#### The Recommending User notebook allows anyone to create its own movie profile by rating movies. Then, it outputs the same two lists the Profile Recommender notebook provides. This way, it recommends movies to anyone who's willing to rate at least 30 movies one's watched.
