#### The coding bat scraper notebook contains the code I used to log in on my codingbat account and get all the answers I developed for each one of the Python's section problems. It creates a notebook for each subsection with all the problems it has, providing the problem statement, the solution code and a print screen of the layout codingbat returns when the code is used to solve the problem on the website. 

##### You can test this notebook by creating an account on the website, copying all my answers to the corresponding problem on eash subsection, running all of them to show the results, putting your credentials on the credentials.yml file and then running the coding bat scraper notebook.
